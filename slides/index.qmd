## Typeset an Exam Paper in LaTeX

- We will be able to learn:

     i. How to create the preamble of the document class
     
     ii. How to create questions with parts and subparts
     
     iii. How to include graphs in Exam questions
     
     iv. How to include tables in Exam questions
     
     v. How to include R/Python Codes in Exam questions
     
     vi. How to create Marking Schemes for each question
     
     vii. How to typset equations in LaTeX
     


## Getting Started in LaTeX

- After opening LaTeX click on File then click on New or just Ctrl+N


- The starting point is to define the `documentclass` type. 

- The `documentclass` sets up what type of document you are working with, loads many default styles and sets the overall look and feel of your document.

- There are also class specific commands which are only valid in certain document classes. 


- There are many more standard classes and even more custom classes usually used for extremely specific purposes.

- It is important to remember that all of these classes are flexible and there is no right way to use them.


## Common Classes and their usage

| documentclass | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| article       | For articles in scientific journals, presentations, short reports, program documentation, etc. Possibly the most versatile class and the one I recommend beginners use almost exclusively at first. |
| report        | For longer reports of several chapters, small books, theses.                                                                                                                                        |
| book          | For books.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| memoir        | For books. Based on book class, but gives a bit more control over look and feel of document in a simple way.                                                                                        |
| letter        | For letters. Has many predefined commands to help correct letter style.                                                                                                                             |
| beamer        | For presentations. As article class is to Microsoft Word, beamer class is to Microsoft Powerpoint.                                                                                                  |


## Note

:::{.callout-note}
Every document must have a class. If you do not have one, the document will not compile. 
:::


## Packages

- Although with just the basic LaTeX package one would theoretically typeset any document, in practice this would be very difficult.

- Luckily, there are **packages** which extend functionality of the language in ways such as improved design elements, graphic generation etc.

:::{.callout-tip}
- The `usepackage` command is always invoked before the `begin{document}` command.

- Some packages have option arguments which go in the square brackets before the curly brackets
:::


## Listing of Common Packages

- `amsmath:` Allows use of extra mathemathical symbols and adds features to facilitate writing mathematical formulas.

- `geometry:` Set up page geometry such as margins.

- `float:` Allows placement of figure and table environments to be fixed by user instead of by LaTeX

- `graphicx:` Allows external image importation of many different formats

- `enumerate:` Allows lists to be enumerated by many different types of characters.

- `TikZ/PGF:` Vectorized drawing package that produces high-quality figures.


## Typeset Mathematics

- For many people the most useful part of LaTeX is the ability to typeset complex mathematical formulas. 

- For the sake of simplicity, LaTeX separates the tasks of typesetting mathematics and typesetting normal text.


| Method                             | Special Characteristics                          | Usage                   |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `$...$`                              | None                                             | In-line Math            |
| `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` | Goes to a newline and center equation with label | Equations               |
| `$$....$$` or `\[...\]`                          | Goes to a newline and center equation            | Equations with no label |



## Most Common LaTeX Mathematical symbols

| Symbol Name                | LaTeX command                | Rendering                    |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Fraction                   | `\frac{x}{y}`                | $\frac{x}{y}$                |
| In-line fraction           | `\dfrac{x}{y}`               | $\dfrac{x}{y}$               |
| Greek Letters              | `\alpha, \beta, \gamma`      | $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$      |
| Integral                   | `\int_{a}^{b}, \iint, \oint` | $\int_{a}^{b}, \iint, \oint$ |
| Properly sized parantheses | `\left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right)`  | $\left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right)$  |
| Summations                 | `\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}`        | $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}$        |



## Typeset Tables in LaTeX

- Tables can be a very efficient way to present information.

- Remember that tables are finicky. 

- It can take some work to get them looking exactly how you want them, but the end product is worth it. 

- Often one will need to play around with the parameters to get the appearance correct.

- Usually use the following [link](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/latex_tables#) to generate Tables in LaTeX.


## Floats

- The table environment is an example of a float. 


| Specifier | Action                                                            |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| H         | Place exactly at spot in source text                              |
| h         | Place approximately at spot in source test                        |
| t         | Place at top of page                                              |
| b         | Place at bottom of page                                           |
| p         | Place on page for floats only                                     |
| !         | Override internal LaTeX parameters for determining float position |


:::{.callout-note}
The **float** package is not necessary if you wish to let LaTeX place the figure for you.
:::


## Graphics

- Often it is useful, if not necessary, to include graphics inside a LaTeX document.

- The code imports a figure and places it into a document while scaling it by 100mm.


```{latex}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=100mm]{atom.png}
\end{figure}
\end{document}
```


:::{.callout-note}
The `\includegraphics` command is part of the graphicx package and can import all the usual file formats including pdf, jpeg, png, etc.
:::


## Captions

- Lets take the figure we had before and add a caption to it. 

- Where the caption goes in relation to the `\includegraphics` command will determine where it is placed on the page


```{latex}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{atom.png}
\caption{This is an atom}
\end{figure}
\end{document}
```


## Setting Paper Size and Margins

- The page dimensions in LaTeX document are highly configurable and the `geometry` package offers a simple way to change the length and the layout of different elements such as:

    i. Paper Size
    
    ii. Margins
    
    iii. Footnotes
    
    iv. header
    
    v. Orientation
    

## Customize Exam Paper Size and Margins

- The following LaTeX code is able to customize the paper size and margins

```{latex}
\usepackage[a4paper, total={210mm,297mm}, left=20mm, right=20mm, top=20mm, bottom=20mm]{geometry}
```


- Produces an a4paper whose dimensions are 210mm by 297mm and the margins are set to 20mm.


## `setspace` package in LaTeX

- The `setspace` package provides commands and environments to change the spacing of your document's lines of text.


:::{.callout-note}
- You can invoke the following spacing options in the preamble of your document:

    i. `\singlespacing`
    
    ii. `\onehalfspacing`
    
    iii. `\doublespacing`
:::


## Page Numbering

- Document page numbers can be typeset using a particular style, such as using *Arabic* or *Roman numerals*, and typeset at a particular page locationâ€”usually within headers or footers.

- The *style* of page numbers can be changed by the `\pagenumbering` command

- The *location* of page numbers can be changed using the `fancyhdr` package


## Setting styles of Page numbers

- The style of page numbers can be changed using the command:

```{latex}
\pagenumbering{style}
```


- The style can take any of the options:

    i. `arabic`: Use arabic numerals 1,2,3...
    
    ii. `alph`: Use lowercase letters a, b,c,...
    
    iii. `Alph`: Use uppercase letters A, B, C...
    
    iv. `roman`: Use lowercase roman numerals i, ii, iii,...
    
    v. `Roman`: Use uppercase roman numerals I, II, III,...
    
    

## Commands

- Most LaTeX commands are simple words preceded by the special character usually `\`, the backslash character. 


### Few Examples

```{latex}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
In a document there are different types of \textbf{commands} 
that define the way the elements are displayed. This 
commands may insert special elements: $\alpha \beta \Gamma$
\end{document}
```


- The `\textbf{}` will embolden the text passed as a parameter to the command.

- In mathematical mode, there are special commands such as `\alpha, \beta, Gamma` to display greek letters.


## Defining a new command

- Although LaTeX is shipped with a huge number of commands it often becomes necessary to define your own special commands to:

    i. `Simplify your work`
    
    ii. `Reduce repetitive tasks`
    
    iii. `Perform some complex formatting`
    

- In this context we will define commands that will help us distribute marks to questions.


## Distributing Marks to Questions

```{latex}
\renewcommand{\mark}[1]{\hspace*{\fill}[{{#1}\:}{mark}]}
\renewcommand{\marks}[1]{\hspace*{\fill}[{{#1}\:}{marks}]}
```


- In the above code:

    i. `\mark and \marks` are the names of the new command
    
    ii. `[1]` is the number of parameters the new command will take
    
    iii. `\hspace*{\fill}` creates a horizontal space between the last word in the sentence and the square brackets.
    
    iv. `[{{#1}\:}{mark}]` is what the command actually does - its definition

## Commands with optional parameters

- You can define commands that take *optional* parameters.

```{latex}
\documentclass{article}
\newcommand{\plusbinomial}[3][2]{(#2 + #3)^#1}
\begin{document}
We can use it like this: \[ \plusbinomial{x}{y} \]
\end{document}
```

- What the command does

    i. `\plusbinomial` is the name of the new command.
    
    ii. `[3]` is the number of parameters the command will take, in this case 3.
    
    iii. `[2]` is the default value for the first parameter. This is what makes the first parameter optional, if not passed it will use this default value.
    
    iv. `(#2 + #3)^#1` is what the command does.

## Warning

:::{.callout-warning}
The new command should be defined in the preamble before the `\begin{document}`
:::


## Question with Sub-Parts in Latex

- More oftenly we encounter a question with subparts say `Question 1 with sub-sections (a) etc which has sub-subsections like (i), (ii),...`

- To enable the questions with sub-parts we use `enumerate` package which determines the style in which the counter is printed.

- An occurrence of one of the tokens `A a I i 1` produces the value of the counter printed with (respectively) `\Alph \alph \Roman \roman or
\arabic.`

## LaTeX Code

```{latex}
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{enumerate}
\begin{document}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
			\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
			\item One
			\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
				\item 
			\end{enumerate}
			\item Two
			\item Three
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
```


## How to Include R/Python/Matlab Codes

- Sometimes you want to include software output in an exam for students to interpret.

- The default tool to display code in LaTeX is `verbatim`, which generates an output in monospaced font.

```{latex}
Call:
lm(formula = Y ~ X)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-0.9207 -0.4380  0.1915  0.3081  0.8224 

Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)  
(Intercept)   0.3207     0.1824   1.758   0.1169  
X             0.5353     0.2173   2.464   0.0391 *
---
Signif. codes:  0 â€˜***â€™ 0.001 â€˜**â€™ 0.01 â€˜*â€™ 0.05 â€˜.â€™ 0.1 â€˜ â€™ 1

Residual standard error: 0.5735 on 8 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.4314,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.3603 
F-statistic: 6.069 on 1 and 8 DF,  p-value: 0.0391
```


## Typeset Marking Schemes 

- LaTeX gives an option to type your solutions while setting the exam questions.

- We will create a `\Newassociation` to enable us link the solutions to each question.



## Newassociation

```{latex}
\Newassociation{solution}{Soln}{solutions}
```

- It creates an environment `{solution}` to be used in your document for the solutions within the problems themselves.
      
  
- It creates an environment `{Soln}` which is the            environment that will be used to display the              solutions. These solutions are written to a              separate file (or files) and then can be input            into your document at a later place
    
    
- It creates a file naming schema for the solution file(s) based on `solutions`. 

- For this to work we shall enclose the set of questions in between `\Opensolutionfile{solutions}[ans]` and `\Closesolutionfile{solutions}`


## How to write the solutions

- In between each question the following syntax is used to type the solution to each question

```{latex}
\begin{solution}
....
\end{solution}
```

- In order to see the file for the solutions in your document invoke the following code at the end of the document


```{latex}
\newpage
\setcounter{page}{1}
\begin{center}
\underline{SPM 2***: UNIT NAME SOLUTIONS}
\par\end{center}
\Readsolutionfile{solutions}
```


## Assigning Checkmarks in LaTeX

- Once done with the solutions the next item is to produce the distribution of marks per each working.

- The following syntax should work:

```{latex}
$\textcolor{red}{\scalebox{2.5}\checkmark{1}}$.
```


- The code does the following:

     i. `\textcolor{red}` - specifies the color of the tick
     
     ii. `{\scalebox{2.5}}` specifies the thickness of the tick
     
     iii. `{\checkmark{1}}` marks to be awarded in this instance one mark is awarded to the working


## Real Work

- We have seen the common typesetting scenarios we will encounter while setting exams.

- I will be able to demonstrate with a set of questions drawn from the following areas:

    
     i. `Pure Mathematics`
     
     ii. `Applied Mathematics`
     
     iii. `Statistics/Actuarial Sciences/Financial Engineering`
     
     iv. `Mathematics and Computer Science`
